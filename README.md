==========

This is a very simple placeholder project featuring lovely elephpants.
It's written on Silex, the microframework based on Symfony 2.

Its Open Source, so you can use the codebase to your very own placeholder thingee.

Still needs some improvements, of course! You are welcome to PR.

Coming Soon:

** Use of configuration files to make the resources more independent
** Black and White images
** More cool elephpant images
